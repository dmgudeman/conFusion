# conFusion
This is the working example for week 1 of the second course in the coursera full
stack web development course.
conFusion is the name of a hypothetical restaurant and the project is to make a
responsive web page.

Screen shot of week 1 assignment. Modified the webpage to include breadcrumbs,
utilized row-content and columns. Added home links to all the home buttons and
the Ristorante Con Fusion text in the navbar.
